=========================

Neighborhood Data Gateway is a site with strengths-based market and neighborhood data to support community development in the St. Louis area.

Neighborhood Data Gateway development was supported by the MidAmerica GIS Consortium (MAGIC) and the PNC Foundation.

Current partners include St. Louis County and Washington University in St. Louis.

In addition, the creation of the Neighborhood Data Gateway would not have been possible without the support of the sponsors and partners of the original St. Louis Neighborhood Market DrillDown.  These visionary supporters recognized the value of accurate, accessible, and strength-based data for our region, which in turn opened the door for the development of the Neighborhood Data Gateway site.
The St. Louis Neighborhood Market DrillDown was supported by:

* PNC Foundation
* Commerce Bank
* US Bank
* Garfield Foundation
* Anonymous Family Foundation
* St. Louis County
* St. Louis City
* AmerenUE
* Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
